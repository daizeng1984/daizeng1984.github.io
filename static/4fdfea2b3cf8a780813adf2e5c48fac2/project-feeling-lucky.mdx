I feel I need a quick keyword linking tools in Vim so that I could keep writing while providing reflink. But I'm too lazy to grab link by myself and I trust Google most of the time. Therefore, this plugin is written to feed my need! It just does the job for me.

## How
Put your cursor on the word and make command `:FeelingLuckyReflink` and you're done.

```
Jekyll --> [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
```

## Vim Plugin again!
Writing python plugin for vim is the easist since Vim script is a little bit obscure for me. Not like last time, my plugins was a module under deoplete and I spent a lot of time to read it. This time, I just need a quick helloworld neovim plugin in Python like [here](https://github.com/jacobsimpson/nvim-example-python-plugin).

Clone to plugged folder and remove vim part. Don't forgot to `UpdateRemotePlugins` and add `:exec` to run function. I probably need command so I changed accordingly as illustrated [here](https://github.com/neovim/python-client). Now just leave the rest for Python requests lib!

%% ```
%%         buf = self.vim.current.buffer
%%         (lnum1, col1) = buf.mark('<')
%%         (lnum2, col2) = buf.mark('>')
%%         lines = self.vim.eval('getline({}, {})'.format(lnum1, lnum2))
%%         if lines :
%%             lines[0] = lines[0][col1:]
%%             lines[-1] = lines[-1][:col2]
%%             self.vim.command('echo "' + "\n".join(lines) + '"')
%%         else:
%%
%% ```

Because of lack of document and examples, and the cursor keeps resetting. Confused... It seems like Functioni will be reset while command is okay...

## Now More Bonus!
I need to add the function of auto tag generation using http://brettterpstra.com/2013/03/23/auto-tagging-jekyll-posts-with-zemanta/
Zemanta is down... So I decided to find a light solution like https://pypi.python.org/pypi/topia.termextract/ https://github.com/ashleyw/phrasie/ and https://www.quora.com/What-are-good-tools-to-extract-key-words-and-or-topics-tags-from-a-random-paragraph-of-text

## Try out RAKE

## Selenium for Robot Defense
Not working, Google block this ip and ask for recaptcha.
## Chromote
It's too complicate and a lot of setup
## API key
AIzaSyCYtnzDWqzPYE6LTtNyuxEZ6pLy6DCkysQ
example: https://github.com/google/google-api-python-client/blob/master/samples/customsearch/main.py
cx  =  014324005263008877010:zmwtfjahkfe
You could get it from the cse's setup->basics-> https://support.google.com/customsearch/answer/2631040?hl=en

## I might need
Save the prevoius reflink and find it and done!
Use db? https://docs.python.org/3/library/shelve.html#example

## Python3
To be able to use python3 you should have folder structure like: https://github.com/neovim/python-client#user-content-remote-new-style-plugins
