Fzf + emoji is fun!ðŸ˜†...

# Vim Fzf

A powerful tool that you should know if you use command lines. I assume you know Fzf well and have it working with Vim.


# Vim Script

We need a plugin from the same author of Fzf: [Vim-Emoji](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-emoji). However, appreantly author didn't bother to tell the `fzf` flavor of this plugin. So here I am:

You need extra scripts to load all emojis from plugin and dump it to fzf so that you can find your emoji with `fzf`!

```vim
function! s:getemoji()
    let keys = emoji#list()
    let retval = []
    for e in keys
        let v = emoji#for(e)
        call add(retval, e . '=' . v)
    endfor
    return retval
endfunction

function! s:addemoji(line)
    let arr = split(a:line, '=')
    execute "normal! a" . arr[1] . "\<Esc>"
endfunction

command! -nargs=* FzfEmoji call fzf#run({
            \ 'source': <sid>getemoji(),
            \ 'sink': function('<sid>addemoji'),
            \ 'down':    '50%'
            \})

```

Now go bind `FzfEmoji` and have fun!
