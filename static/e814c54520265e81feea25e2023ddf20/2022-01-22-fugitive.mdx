Most powerful git tool human ever created...

# Why

This is just a simple tutorial to features I found useful in [Fugitive.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive).

In my experience, Fugitive is like a surgery tool directly operating on these SHA objects in `.git`. There's basically nothing it cannot do and it sounds so illegal. However, it's not foolproof type of product, instead, you need to dive deeper into its documents and tutorial to find your way. So this blog is just to summarize my way. But I hope it's also useful for you.

# Basic Concept
First, you need to understand what's `fugitive object` in their tutorial. We have 3 types of object: `tree`, `blob` and `commit`. `tree` is folder structure; `blob` is file; and `commit` is the commit. All of them are coded in SHA to refer to. 

[Here](https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive/blob/master/doc/fugitive.txt#L593-L615)'s the example for how Fugitive refers to these objects. But it's much more than you could use in daily life though! What I found useful are:

```
HEAD~2 HEAD's previous 2 commit object and @ equals HEAD if you like to type short
branch:filename e.g. master:% current file blob

```
