You don't need to learn Rust to enjoy its benefits (fast & secure flavor). This post is ads of the tools written by Rust and I enjoy using so far!

# AdsðŸ˜‰
+ **RipGrep**: `grep` < `ag` < `rg`. Fast fast fast and `-uuu`!
+ **Fd**: replacement of find. Fast and colorful!
+ **Exa**: replacement for ls and colorful!
+ **Zoxide**: `j/autojump` < `z/fasd` < `zoxide`
+ **Skim**: fzf competitor. or go vs rustðŸ˜„. who is faster and who is more secure. interesting!
+ **Cbs**: my replacement for xclip/xsel etc. cross *nix window clipboard!
+ **Tickrs**: fast ticker for market watch


Last ads about OS: Redox, a crazy idea and a lot of work to do but I'd like to try if released...
