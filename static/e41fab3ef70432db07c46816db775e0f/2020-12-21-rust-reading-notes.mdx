While baby is sleeping, let's get some readings and keep notes...

# Why? Rust? 
[Perform like C++](https://benchmarksgame-team.pages.debian.net/benchmarksgame/which-programs-are-fastest.html) yet without the historical burdens. Speaks like a cool scripting lang yet powerful enough to handle system level.

![Rust Popular](https://media.nature.com/lw800/magazine-assets/d41586-020-03382-2/d41586-020-03382-2_18629102.png)

# Rust In Action (MEAP) (‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê) [Rust Cook Book](https://rust-lang-nursery.github.io/rust-cookbook/intro.html) [Rust Dark Art](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/index.html)

Expected to find some lang system level explanation (e.g. virtual function table, garbage collector mechanism) instead of common lang features. Also multi-threading is great topic if it can cover. 



## Intros
### Number Type
* Conversion is explicit through `as`
* Each type has its method like *24.5_f32*.`round()` is method to round *24.5_f32* to *25*.
* Format type "{:b}{:o}{:x}". 
* Float comparison is tolerate with e.g. `f32::EPSILON`.
* `num` crate extend primitive types to support e.g. complex, big integer/infinite float, fixed point currency decimal

### Iteration
* for x in 0..10 
* for x in `collection.iter()` or `&collection`
* `iter_mut` is mutable while `into_iter` is value typed

### Flow
* loop { if ... break }
* match `0..=40` is range of [0, 40], `|` is or and `_` is otherwise

### Function Signature
* fn lifetime<'a, 'b>(x: &'a i32, y: &' i32) -> i32
* fn add<T: std::ops::Add<Output=T> + std::ops::Multiply >
* str -> c style stack/static ; String -> std::string heap and I *guess* primitive follow the same pattern vs Box.
* Arrays -> c style Slice -> new/malloc Vector -> c++ vec
* #![allow(unused_variables)] #![allow(dead_code)] and unimplemnted! macro

### Struct
* tuple Example(i32,...) is anonymous struct and reference element by .0 .1 .2 ...
* name: String == [u8; name.size ] and data: Vec<u8\> == [u8; data.size] and they are most possibly on heap
* impl, self and return (default last one, note `;`) 

### Implementation
* unsafe block is used when check global in system level programming, and static globals are all capital
* panic! to throw exception
* const vs let: const is like c/c++ `const` during compile time and define fixed array while `let` is runtime. `let` is more of shared reference and it can be shadowed and convert to mut.
* Result<T, String> -> Ok(T) or Err(String) and `unwrap()`
* trait ... fn(self &Self ...) and impl SomeTrait for YourClass. It's like interface and implements/extend
* `#[derive(Debug)]` is for auto trait generation and format as {:?}
* pub as export, pub module can be pub(crate) in crate, pub(super) to parent pub(in path) to modules in path
* //! for modules/files /// for next code and `rustdoc` to render the documents

## Lifetime, Ownership & Borrowing
* Copy trait is not implement unless primitive type. Assigning value leads ownership transfer. Not convenient but this avoid c/c++ copy/move constructor assumption issue (make things clear).
* Drop is extra customized destructor traits that run with default one in case you want to do some extras
* Ownership moves through: assignment including function arguments/returns. Tracing these ownership relief garbage collecting burden.
* Copy vs Clone: Copy happens at assignment or ownership transfer, all primitive type implements this; Clone is clone trait. You can use compiler to generate bit by bit (shallow) copy/clone #[derive(Debug,Clone,Copy)].
* use std::rc::Rc is std::shared_ptr, Rc is immutable, however RefCell<T\> can wrap it to make struct internal mutable via `.borrow_mut()`. Note these 2 are **not** threadsafe, while Arc<Mutex<T\>\> is.
* raw memory interprets: unsafe { std::mem::transmute(a) };

# Integer
* Integer overflow, big/little endian, f32 ieee format and Q7 format (new to me). In these case, try to use function like checked_*(add) or overflow_*
* bit op: 1u32 << 1
* mod similar to namespace, mod.rs is for folder.
* `#[cfg(test)]` and cargo test

# Pointer vs Reference
* Reference is safe; pointer is unsafe: raw pointer it can be null and no check; smart pointer 
* Box like java is used to box primitive types. Make them of struct flavor
* Raw pointer: let ptr = &obj as * const u8 as *mut u8 // &reference cannot be cast directly to mut üôÇ
* Cow copy on write smart pointer, if read, no copy!
* all pointers listed (note not applicable means not directly used) as below:

| Name | Usage | Pros | Cons |
|:-----|:------:|------:| ------:|
| Raw Pointer | &obj as * const u8 as * mut u8 | speed/acess other system  | unsafe |
| Box<T\> | Box<T\>::new(..) | in heap wrapped in obj | size overhead |
| Rc<T\> | Rc<T\>::new(..) | safe share | size/runtime cost/thread unsafe |
| Arc<T\> | ARc<T\>::new(..) | thread safe Rc | same as Rc | 
| Cell<T\> | Cell<T\>::new(..) | unmutify obj | size/cost |
| RefCell<T\> | RefCell<T\>::new(..) | unmut & combine with Rc/Arc | size/cost/no compile check |
| Cow<T\> | Cow:from(..) | avoid clone if read | size |
| String | String::from(str) | resizable/encoding check | size/cost |
| Vec<T\> | Vec<T\>::new([]) | resizeable | size/cost |
| RawVec<T\> | RawVec<T, A: Alloc\>::new([]) | resizeable/allocator | behind Vec & VecDeq, not applicable in code |
| Unique<T\> | Unique<T\>::new(..) | c++ unique_ptr used by String, Vec etc. | not applicable in code |
| Shared<T\> | Shared<T\>::new(..) | c++ shared_ptr used by Rc, Arc etc. | not applicable in code |
| Weak<T\> | rc::Weak::new(..) arc::Weak::new(..) | c++ weak_ptr/threadsafe | size/cost | 
| UnsafeCell<T\> | ? | unsafe | not applicable in code |

* AsRef<T\> and AsMut<T\> to support low cost similar to Borrow, need to pay attention to Borrow Cow ToOwned and AsRef!
* Box:new, * unary and drop -> C++ new/delete
* Trace heap: timeout 20 ltrace -T -o trace.txt -e -*+malloc+free+realloc ./target/debug/particles
* Rust can access low level system api like c/c++, e.g. winapi, kernel32

## File & Storage
* serde -> serialize/deserialize -> support json, cbor, bincode, with annotation e.g. #[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)]
* let a = br#"...."#; //multiline string format as bytes
* unwrap->expect("error message")
* OpenOptions::new().read(true).write(true).create(true)... Java flavor builder for options
* Path and PathBuf
* #[cfg(target_os="linux")] -> ifdef __LINUX__
* ? for std Result handling, Ok-> unwrap Err-> return
* Riak and Bitcask db (guarantee never lost data)

## Official Guide Reading Notes

# [The Official Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/title-page.html)

Nice example based learning see [here](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/)

## Data Types

```rust
i8, i16, i32, i64, i128, isize
u8, u16, u32, u64, u128, usize
f32, f64
char (unicode 4 bytes) //b"..." is bytes[u8] and only ascii "..." is str type
bool
() empty tuple
struct Tensor(i32, i32) //tuple
struct Point{
x: i32, y: i32
}
enum PointType {
    OneDimension, // default 0 but can be =1
    TwoDimension,
    ThreeDimension,
} //enum

[T; length] //array
const COMPILE_TIME_VALUE : i32 = 10;
static STATIC_VALUE : &str = 'Unsafe'; // unsafe if you mut it
let mut mutable = 1; //can change but you can let mutable = mutable; to unmut it üòÑ
```

* Immutable variable vs const: const is compile time (c++ const) while immutable is for runtime. You can mut immutable vars.
* You can shadow immutable vars but shadowing different type cannot happens
* arch type like isize and usize is depending on pc arch used
* overflow handling is suggested as wrapping_* (mod) , checked_* (-> None if overflow) overflowing_* (->(val, boolean)) and saturating_* (clamp at min/max) (* can be add/substract etc.) See rust makes junior aware these issues instead of hiding like c/c++!!!
* char is 4byte
* tuple let a = (1,2.0,'a') and a.0 is 1 and destructing like let (x, y, z) = a
* arrays is familiar c++/c flavor, compile time length on stack let a = [3; 5]. Out of index is protected (no invalid memory access) by rust in run time.

## Functions
* snake_case convention. 
* statement doesn't return: let x = let y = 5 or let x = y = 5 is invalid. See rust kill these brain teaser statementüëç.

## Flow
* if condition must be bool. Because a lot of implicit bool in other lang brings a lot of monsters. as expression let x = if con {1} else {2}; is valid as long as type is the same
* loop with break as expression let x = loop { ... break 2 };
* for n in nums.iter() or for n in (1..4)
```rust
for x = 1..=n {
    ...
}
match number {
    1 => println!("One!"),
    2 | 3 | 5 | 7 | 11 => println!("This is a prime"),
    13..=19 => println!("A teen"),
    _ => println!("Ain't special"),
}
```


## Ownership
Unique features to enforce memory allocation awareness and foster good habits. Rust want to be as powerful as c/c++ to take advantage of different memory models!
* scope c/c++ similar RAII
* str expression e.g. "hell,world" -> c style static/global; str -> c style string in stack; String -> c++ std::string in heap
* all primitives on stack follow the similar pattern because they have Copy trait. When you do assignment Rust will never automatically create ‚Äúdeep‚Äù copies. Rust choose to transfer ownership and invalidate the previous owner unless you impl Copy.
* Tuple has copy if all its field has
* mutable references have one big restriction: you can have only one mutable reference to a particular piece of data in a particular scope and we cannot borrow mutable ref if an immutable ref was created and used later; to sum up, as long as there's mutable ref, other immutable ref shouldn't exist!!!
* let slice = &s[0..5] , &s[..5] or &[2..] to refer to chunk of bytes

## Struct
* let user2 = User { email, ..user };
* reference field will be checked to force you specify lifetime
* `[#derive(Debug)]` macros annotates print gen for `{:?}`
* `[#derive(PartialEq)]`:  == (all field eq) and != gen; Eq is PartialEq with one more check (a == a) so usually is marker behind like `[#derive(PartialEq, Eq)]`; HashMap<K, V\> requires Eq
* `[#derive(PartialOrd)]`: require PartialEq implemented, partial_cmp -> Option<Ordering> (None, Less, Equal, Greater)
* `[#derive(Clone)]`: clone requires all implement clone, copy is shallow copy on stack for fast
* `[#derive(Hash)]`: hash
    
    


### impl to attach fn
```rust
impl Abstract {
    fn ...
}
```

### type conversion
Require impl the traits if you convert e.g. &str -> String
```rust
impl From<i32> for Number { //TryFrom is the fallible equivalent
    fn from(s: i32) -> Self {
        Number { value: s }
    }
}
```
