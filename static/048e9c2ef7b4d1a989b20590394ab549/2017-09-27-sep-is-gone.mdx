My september is like totally gone! Well, in some sense, not true. Besides work, I did a lot of paperwork, tax, visa, booking, rental, eye glasses repair, all regarding the things you have to do!

# Thought
Distraction can eat up your time. Technically I knew this principle, but it's hard to keep yourself away from it. Sometimes, too many tiny little chores (you have to ...) can bury you into the busy world of non-sense. In this situation, perhaps we need to cool down and think about it.

Here's some maybe-give-a-try ideas:
* Use your hour rate to prioritize but don't over use this biased measure
* Redesign your office environment to make it as less distraction as possible
* Track your time and restrict some websites e.g. [Clean Youtube](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/remove-youtube-recommende/hfnghnjkcpgagjbiheidccjnneoipbmb?hl=en) as suggested in my previous post.
* Draw a big picture (画大饼) for your future and put it into serious planning.
