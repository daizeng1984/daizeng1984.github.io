Ninja Gaiden is a nightmare game when I was kid... This is the ninja game for real ninja. Jump & slash, swift moving and never hesitate. I cannot beat this game as a kid and still struggle today. But now [dqn](https://deepmind.com/research/dqn/) sounds so powerful that we probably got some chances?
