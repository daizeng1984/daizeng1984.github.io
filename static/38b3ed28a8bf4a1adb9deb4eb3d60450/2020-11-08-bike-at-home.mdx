<!-- # Congrats to Winner 🎉🎉🎉 -->
<!-- Today finally United States has decided its next 4 year's path. Hope this path will be better for pandemic control, science, understanding and peace of world. People all over the world need get together to fight the COVID-19 and climate crisis for next generation. At the moment when I heard `united`, I was somewhat touched. I know rocky way ahead, but let's hope and aim the best 🙏. 2020 will soon be the past. -->

# Standup Desk?
No. If you want to burn more calories in this pandemic age, better solution is biking desk! Recently I'm loving this biking desk from [Flexispot](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0762FFNQ4). Working while draining massive calories! Keep fit and healthy! Undoubtably 5 stars was given on Amazon review and I bought 2. In ~3 mo, I burnt 30 pound and that's incredible! I think in this way, I'm 10% ready for Mars immigration.

I think with VR, this bike at home idea probably could get more interesting😂.

# Durability 
Even though officially they don't recommend this as workout bike (what? 😂), the durability is a problem if you like to burn calories everyday. After ~6 mo intensive biking, my first one broke: the belt cannot last long.

The solution is to open it and replace the belt. Not an easy path and I need bike tool like [this](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B087FWSHG5) and tons of strength (weight training 🤔) to remove the bike crank. Of course I need to buy replacement belt, however, the one with exact ribs is not available so I customized it by cutting [this](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00CJK78Z4) 10 ribs belt.

After a lot of unscrewing and cut the old belt, I came to actually install the new belt.

The trick is to partially put belt on track and carefully *rotate* the wheel so that the belt will latch on perfectly.
