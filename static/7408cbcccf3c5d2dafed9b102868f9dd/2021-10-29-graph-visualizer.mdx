import {FlowVis} from '../adhoc/blog/all-wrapped.js'

found a simple and graph visualizer to give a try ...

# Simple
I used to make [fancy graph](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12ku-mqtJtsGfC8rbUQUMC2GTXgjWDHhl/view?usp=sharing) for visualization apps. But sometimes I just want something simple, browser accessible and enable me to quickly visualize some json DAG or flow chart. Got this nice workflow visualizer from github ([Flow-Kit](https://github.com/d-band/flow-kit)) and happy to use it as a tool. Also thanks to excellent react json viewer ([rjv](https://github.com/mac-s-g/react-json-view)). Now we have this graph visualizer takes simple json ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰.

Oh, it actually just requires informal JSON as we usually write in Javascript which means you don't need to use double quotes for keys!

# Next
Next I want it to be flexible for all json format: I can visciously `eval` a Javascript snippet for converting any data or json into the correct format.

TODO:
- [] Add eval to input
- [] Add debounce for input change

# Further
Make url take parameters of json format... a crappy jump link visualizer ðŸ˜‚
