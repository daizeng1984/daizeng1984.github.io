Who doesn't love faster tool?

# TL;DR
```.sh
conda install -y -n base -c conda-forge conda-libmamba-solver
```

# Introduction
Basically a rewrite of conda in C++. It's also multithreaded. However, you have to remember this new name `mamba`. You can also use pure C++ micromamba to do bootstrap which is a pure package manager that have no python or anything.

However, you don't need to install and change your muscle memory to `mamba` mode. You can directly install mamba dep solver to use conda as you used to and get faster code.
