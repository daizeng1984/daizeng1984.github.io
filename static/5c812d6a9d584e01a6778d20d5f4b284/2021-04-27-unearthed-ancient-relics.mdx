These ancient magic powered machina are more than 10 years ago. It was operated by ancient 'experts'...

# Reminder
Ok, here's my ancient sites: http://blog.sina.com.cn/u/1889114642 . Some are in Chinese and others are poorly written English (also true for now ðŸ˜‰).

Today, I just got an overdue `reminder` from sina that I should migrate my page or at least backup images: they shut down sina photo/image store after 2019 which reminds me they could dump my everything when for example they need extra disk usage some years later. Same reminder happened 10+ years ago as well when MSN shut down. It reminds me I should always backup ancient blog.

Also I hope github free land will be there forever...


# Plan
I need to recover my original post resources (e.g. images) from my backup tomb. I need also remove duplicate content if any.

Big plan: I copy and paste things to this blog one post per I am not lazy.


Posts recover so far:
