I was quit excited by the new OpenGL 4.3 feature: imageLoad/imageStore. It means you can skip hardware rasterization to render images. So I tried it out in [IGLU](http://cwyman.org/code/iglu_0.5.0.zip) and it works pretty well! I added some ambient and did ray matching computing for better visualization of voxels.
