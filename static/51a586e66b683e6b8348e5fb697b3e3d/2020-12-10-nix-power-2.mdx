Just cool ...

# Feel the Power of Nix
To build a reproducible env is the Nix's Ultimate Power. You can live without NixOS or not using Home-Manager. But this one is the essential of Nix. This post is to illustrate what you can perform with Nix.

# Direnv
Nix ‚ù§ Direnv. These two are so powerful. Direnv grants you seamless environment while Nix guarantees they are reliable and reproducible instantly. My rest blogs are merely snippets and tips to showcase/advertise this combination. BTW, direnv can [work with conda](https://github.com/daizeng1984/dotfiles/blob/master/direnv/.direnvrc) too!

# NodeJS

```nix
# Nixpkgs 20.09
# no -g/global install needed! node_modules/.bin is in PATH when in this folder
# { pkgs ? import <nixpkgs> {} }:
{ pkgs ? 
import (builtins.fetchTarball {
      name = "nixos-20.09";
      url = "https://codeload.github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/tar.gz/20.09";
      sha256 = "1wg61h4gndm3vcprdcg7rc4s1v3jkm5xd7lw8r2f67w502y94gcy";
  }) {}
}:

pkgs.mkShell {
  buildInputs = with pkgs; [
    nodejs
    yarn
  ];

  shellHook = ''
    export PATH="$PWD/node_modules/.bin/:$PATH"
    echo "üöÄ nodejs ready!"
  '';

  MY_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE = "dummy";
}
```
Here usually you pin down to a particular nixpkgs to make sure the reproducibility. Remember `npm install -g`? Now it's not allowed and neither good practice. You just install to local `node_modules` folder and export the `node_modules/.bin` path.

# Emscripten
Webassembly? Easy piece:

```nix
let
   emscriptenPackages.zlib
in 
pkgs.mkShell {
  buildInputs = with pkgs; [
    emscripten
    emscriptenPackages.zlib
    webfs # webfs -F -p 3000 to serve current folder
  ];
}
```

Nixpkgs already has common emscriptenPackages ready but if you can compile your own as shown [here](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/master/doc/languages-frameworks/emscripten.section.md#user-content-usage-2-pkgsbuildemscriptenpackage).

# Rust

```nix
let
  moz_overlay = import (builtins.fetchTarball https://github.com/mozilla/nixpkgs-mozilla/archive/master.tar.gz);
  nixpkgs = import <nixpkgs> { overlays = [ moz_overlay ]; };
  ruststable = (nixpkgs.latest.rustChannels.stable.rust.override { extensions = [ "rust-src" "clippy-preview" "rls-preview" "rust-analysis" "rustfmt-preview" ];});
in
with nixpkgs;
mkShell {
  buildInputs = [ 
    openssl 
    pkg-config
    nasm
    ruststable
    rustup
    cmake
    zlib 
  ];

  shellHook = ''
    export PATH=$HOME/.cargo/bin:$PATH
  '';
}
```
New and fast evolving lang, you have to overlay nightly pkgs from Mozilla. Relax, nixpkgs master is stable than you thought!

# Python
Install pkgs in read-only nix python is impossible. You either use local pip (virtual python env) or manage packages in nix. With nix, you don't need to worry about the native package like cython etc..
```nix
...
:
let
  pythonEnv = pkgs.python38.withPackages (ps: [
    ps.numpy
    ps.pytorch
    ps.dateutil
  ]);
in pkgs.mkShell {
  buildInputs = with pkgs; [
    pythonEnv
    libffi
    openssl
  ];
}

```

If you are dealing with pure py pkgs or has no friendly admin
# Cpp
Nix is the best CPP dev pkg manager in *nix OS I'd say, since C++ pkgs are mostly low level and OS related. For continuous integration I haven't look into Nix power, but for reproducible dev environment setup under linux. Nix provides the best solution.

## NDK

# Jdk
## Android

# 

# Non-Root
If this bothers you ...

1. Namespace `nix-user-chroot`. However, it cannot support [tmux reattachment](TODO) (hope this is tmux fault).
2. Proot allow tmux to reattach, however, it has limit os support for certain system call which is very hard to find out when it happens. 
3. Build your own stuff and troubleshooting all on your own.

Namespace is recommended however in Mac it seems to be impossible.
