Feeling excited ðŸ¤“ to be able to find a magic trick for old MFC-7360N's duplex scanning.

# Best CLI of Today
```bash
pdftk A=even.pdf B=odd.pdf shuffle A Bend-1 output merged.pdf
```
This command reverses document `B` and then shuffles with `A`. Fast and easy. No need to upload pdf to unreliable website or install any bulky pricy software. Just one line.

In Mac OS X El Captain, please install [this one](https://www.pdflabs.com/tools/pdftk-the-pdf-toolkit/pdftk_server-2.02-mac_osx-10.11-setup.pkg).

Just love these [one liners](https://www.pdflabs.com/docs/pdftk-cli-examples/)
