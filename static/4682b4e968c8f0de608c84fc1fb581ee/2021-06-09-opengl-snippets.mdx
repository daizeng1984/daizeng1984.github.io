 Recently starting to review OpenGL and figure a good chance to make tool sharp to survive in wild OpenGL Programming...

# Prerequisites
Install your favorite snippets engine e.g. coc-snippets and point it to your customized snippets like I did [here](?).

# GL
## Header
I meant wild but not naked. Some almost must-have headers. With GLFW, you don't need to worry about GL context binding to native window. With GLAD you care less about OGL entry point. GLM saves you some scratch work to implement e.g. vec2.
