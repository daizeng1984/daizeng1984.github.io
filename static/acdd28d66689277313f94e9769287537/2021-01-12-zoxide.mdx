You don't need to learn Rust to enjoy its benefits (fast & secure flavor). This post is ads of the tools written by Rust and I enjoy using so far!

* **RipGrep**: `grep` \< `ag` \< `rg`. Fast!
* **Fd**: better modern find. fast!
* **Zoxide**: `j/autojump` \< `z/fasd` \< `zoxide`
* **Skim**: fzf competitor. or a case of go vs rustðŸ˜„.
* **Cbs**: cross *nix window clipboard.


Last ads about OS: Redox, a crazy idea but still a lot of work to do...
