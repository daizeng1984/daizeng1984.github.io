Most powerful git tool human ever created...

# Why

This is just a simple tutorial to features I found useful in [Fugitive.vim]().

# Basic Concept
First, you need to understand what's `fugitive object` in their tutorial. We have 3 types of object: `tree`, `blob` and `commit`. `tree` is folder structure; `blob` is file; and `commit` is the commit. All of them are coded in SHA to refer to. 

[Here](https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive/blob/master/doc/fugitive.txt#L593-L615)'s the example for how Fugitive refers to these objects.

Fugitive is like a surgery tool directly operating on these SHA objects in git or `.git`.
