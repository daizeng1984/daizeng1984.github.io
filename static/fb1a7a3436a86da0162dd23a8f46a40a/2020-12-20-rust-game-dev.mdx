Taste next gen C/C++ lang...

# Bugs
If you played Cyberpunk 2077 at this time on consoles, you'll hate the bugs like missing texture/geom, crappy physics, weird AI etc. and most of them look very mutithready. Symptom shows this game's threading is messily async under console compiler env and thus not playable. But it's good lesson for developers.

Game developer tends to aim for maximum efficiency with limit hardware budget (a few milliseconds for 30fps, shooter game even higher). Bad habits foster e.g. never care about segment fault and memory security. It makes sense if game hack is not that critical as long as it doesn't impact game sales, gamer might just reboot and no one's bank account is going to be hacked. A bit risky thinking modelü§î.

Rust, as a more secure and yet efficient lang, recently catches my eyes and [some people](https://hub.packtpub.com/rust-as-a-game-programming-language-is-it-any-good/) believe it can replace (at least somewhat) the long-live C++ for game dev. Even though lang itself is not the one to blame for messy C++ game code, I still wish there'll be a cleaner/stricter language to branch from C++ (instead of merging tons of developer requests) so that developer doesn't need to create their own wheels, e.g. hack memory model etc. and has less tedious code review check. C++ after 2013ish is full of sugars. It becomes more and more syntax-complicate that amounts to a new language. Too many historical burdensüôÅ. Developers under C++ are free to not following strict rules they should have which potentially leading to hard-to-find bugs like uninitialized resources, out boundary index, possibly lock threads etc..

Rust uses stricter compiling check to make sure a more reliable run time code, which means like a good human language teacher Rust requires you to elaborate your statements to make things clear. A lot of system level cli app I used are written by Rust. Besides, with like other mainstream langs, it has friendlier pkg manager than C++. It definitely up a level to old C/C++.

# Rust
To learn Rust, [here](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)'s the official course. To play it, either `Nix` it like introduced in my previous [post](./2020-12-10-nix-power-2) or webly [here](https://play.rust-lang.org/).

# Engines

## Gate
2D engine and target webassembly

## Amethyst
[Amethyst](https://www.amethyst.rs/) seems to be almost ripe and it support [Nix](./2020-10-24-nix-power) so let's try that out. It uses entity components system to model multithread behavior I guess similar to actor framework etc. by Erlang. These model ensured some atomity behavior to avoid dead lock etc.. 

You need to pin down to `1.47.0` according to this [issue](https://github.com/amethyst/amethyst/issues/2524). Of course for 3D graphics, also run with `[nixGL]()` to enable hardware for non nixos env like my centos.

```nix
let
  mozilla = import (builtins.fetchTarball https://github.com/mozilla/nixpkgs-mozilla/archive/master.tar.gz);
  nixpkgs = import <nixpkgs> { overlays = [ mozilla ]; };
in
with nixpkgs;
mkShell {
  buildInputs = [
    alsaLib
    cmake
    freetype
    (rustChannelOf { channel = "1.47.0"; }).rust
    expat
    openssl
    pkgconfig
    python3
    vulkan-validation-layers
    xlibs.libX11
  ];

  APPEND_LIBRARY_PATH = stdenv.lib.makeLibraryPath [
    vulkan-loader
    xlibs.libXcursor
    xlibs.libXi
    xlibs.libXrandr
  ];

  shellHook = ''
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$APPEND_LIBRARY_PATH"
  '';
}
```
