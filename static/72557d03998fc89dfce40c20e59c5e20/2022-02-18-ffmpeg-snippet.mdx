Why would ppl design API like this?

# Motivation
Like opengl, these low level api is very tedious and old. It's not aiming for usability. I'm surprised that we don't even have a header only wrapper for ffmpeg? This time let's first use boilerplate snippet to fix.

This is for whoever "Just Want to Load Video and Get the RGBA!".

# FFMPEG 101
Each video file or `*.mp4` is composed of video stream, audio stream. For each stream, they are stored as `packet` by `packet` or `blob` by `blog`. However, these `packet` are not straightforward to view as a frame of picture. You need to decode it to see the real RGBA images which is called `frame`. `frame` has different format other than RGBA. Most of cases, you need to convert them, e.g. from YUV (which stores like YYYYYYY....UUUUU.....VVVVVVV....) to RGBA (RGBARGBARGBA...).

# Snippets
Like opengl's hello world, ffmpeg's hello world is neither mercy for beginner üòÅ. 

The process is:
1. load file (with meta information)
2. find decoder
3. find streams
4. decode streams
5. convert frame
6. done

# Header Only Wrapper?

# Bonus
What if performance is not my concern? and I just want to hack something...
