Merry Christmas and happy coding!

# Hack
Inspired by [this](http://asciimoji.com/) chrome plugin I added some [Denite](https://github.com/Shougo/denite.nvim) menu to help type emoji in vim. I would say [this](https://github.com/daizeng1984/dotfiles/blob/master/neovim/nvim/config/functions/asciiemoji.vimrc) should be an `efficiency` tool to motivate people leave comment for their code. Sometime it can catch code reviewer attention as well. Yeah, ʕ·͡ᴥ·ʔ.
