Marvel has an excellent framework to integrate its comics into a unified Marvel universe. Let's see if we can apply the same framework to [Shanghai Animation Film Studio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai_Animation_Film_Studio)'s movies and TV series to make another hero universe.

# Titles We Plans to Integrate

### [Calabash Brothers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calabash_Brothers)
Seven brave kids fight snake woman and her minions to save grandpa & protect friends of gourdian mountain. Each gourdian kid has one super power, e.g. titanization etc... In later sequal, seven kids merges into one with seven super power.

### [Lengend of Effendi](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E9%98%BF%E5%87%A1%E6%8F%90%E7%9A%84%E6%95%85%E4%BA%8B)
This one is challenging. It's a mid-eastern legend story, without any super power! However, we could define its super power to be wisdom. Or some mytherous high dimensional ability like doctor strange.

### [Three Monks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Monks)
Very ancient story of three monks trying to refill water in temple. We could take water as their super power. It gives life for planets in universe and three monks are likely from high civilization that observe galaxy and trying to allocate limited water/life resources.

### [Adventure of Shulk & Beta](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E8%88%92%E5%85%8B%E5%92%8C%E8%B4%9D%E5%A1%94)
Mouse brothers has no super power but a bunch of self made helicopter and tank. We could give them super power like high tech genius.

# Background Setup
We need to set the background to universe. Once you set it as universe, it brings so much flexibility to connect across different titles and make your story logical and convincing when you bring all heroes & heorines together.

We need a big villain and a mainline story. Let's create it: `Thinos` mapping to Marvel's `Thanos`.

Thinos新诺斯，银河系Betelgeuse星系的泰坦族，早年因阿雷西亚的入侵心中种下了仇恨的种子，长大后领导各路阿雷西亚的反抗势力推翻了帝国并夺取了Caliber（克隆兵工厂）的控制权，大清洗阿雷西亚族人。

阿雷西亚全灭之前，向银河系各地发出种子胶囊(Seeds)，里面包含了阿雷西亚最强的基因技术
