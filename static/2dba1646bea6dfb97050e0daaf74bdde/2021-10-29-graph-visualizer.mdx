import {FlowVis} from '../adhoc/blog/all-wrapped.js'

found a simple and graph visualizer to give a try ...

# Simple
I used to make fancy graph for visualization apps. But sometimes I just want something simple, online browser accessible and can help me quickly visualize some json DAG or flow chart. Got this nice workflow visualizer from Google and happy to use it as a tool.

Oh, it actually just requires informal JSON as we usually write in Javascript which means you don't need to use double quotes for keys!

# Next
Next I want it to be flexible for all json format: I can visciously `eval` a Javascript snippet for converting any data or json into the correct format.

TODO:
- [] Add eval to input and add debounce for input change

# Even Further
