In this computer vision project, we evaluated four image registration methods including point-based rigid transformation and anisotropic scaling, iterative closest point algorithm and intensity-based registration using mutual information and compare them using indices like sum of squared differences, correlation coefficient, joint entropy, normalized mutual information and employ t-test.
