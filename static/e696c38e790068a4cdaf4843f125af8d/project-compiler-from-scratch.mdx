A course for one project: building a compiler for [Falcon](http://homepage.cs.uiowa.edu/~jones/compiler/falcon/) (a C-style "toy" language created by Prof. [Douglas Jones](http://homepage.cs.uiowa.edu/~jones/)). We built everything using C/C++ and have it run on [Raspberry Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org/). It can parse most of the statements and translate them into ARM assembly language.
