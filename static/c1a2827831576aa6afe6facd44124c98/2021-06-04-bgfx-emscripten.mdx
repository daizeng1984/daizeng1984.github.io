bgfx support many platform, let's see if we can embed it on this post...

# Bgfx + Emscripten?

* [Bgfx](https://github.com/bkaradzic/bgfx) is a powerful rendering API help you to deal with lots of cross platform/low-level graphics API stuff!

* [Emscripten](https://emscripten.org/) allows you code in familiar native language like C++ and compile it to WebAssembly (wasm) that runs in browser. There are some limitation of course but good thing about wasm is: your app can be accessed by anyone with modern browser (webgl).

* WebGL & mobile graphics is the relative low end, if you manage to run on these platform, it also prove that it can run anywhere else.

* If you are believer of wasm ...

[Here](https://github.com/daizeng1984/bgfx.emscripten)'s code repo to compile a simple example from bgfx.

# Tips
1. Using nix and direnv saved a lot of rampup works, if you are interested. Check out my previous [post](./2020-12-10-nix-power-2).
2. BGFX can build wasm but failed to compile some examples, you need to compile wasm without example like [this](https://github.com/daizeng1984/bgfx.emscripten/blob/master/Makefile#L76)
3. Emscripten provides virtual file system but you need to specify the path in configuration and use @: `path@virtualpath`
4. To use emcc with webgl or glfw you need to treat specially instead of compile yourself. A bunch of [flags](https://github.com/daizeng1984/bgfx.emscripten/blob/master/Makefile#L29) I have to add to make things work.
5. shader and assets build requires tools build. You can write your own [make](https://github.com/daizeng1984/bgfx.make/blob/master/assets/Makefile) or reuse [ninja script](https://github.com/daizeng1984/bgfx.emscripten/blob/master/assets/build.ninja) from examples.
6. To generate `compile_commands.json`, you can use [compiledb](https://github.com/daizeng1984/bgfx.emscripten/blob/master/default.nix#L10).
7. To serve the local wasm html files, you can just `miniserve -p 9000` which is included in the nix.
8. To debug the wasm, you need to add `-g` flag and use google-chrome browser with DWARF plugin (see [here](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/wasm-debugging-2020/)).


If you have some patience and modern browser, you should be able to see the 3D bunny in the iframe below:

<div style="
  position: relative;
