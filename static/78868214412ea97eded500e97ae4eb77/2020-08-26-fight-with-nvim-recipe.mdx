Track issues...

# Motivation
Just want to contribute a bit back to community and also I heavily relies on conda on my environment setup. Conda compare brew it has advantage of self contains [cross building environment](./2018-11-18-conda-everything) and more control to versioning.

This post is just my tracking board in case I forgot these PR:

* [neovim](https://github.com/conda-forge/staged-recipes/pull/12493)
* [fasd](https://github.com/conda-forge/staged-recipes/pull/12584)
* [zoxide](https://github.com/conda-forge/staged-recipes/pull/13682)


# Problems
## Neovim
### Libtool Hardcoded Path
> Conda build env is not reproducible

Remember conda is heavily home-folderable, it doesn't require root permission; it doesn't hardcoded path; so ...

Some logs:
```sh
# Which release of libtool.m4 was used?
macro_version=2.4.6
macro_revision=2.4.6

# Assembler program.
AS="/Users/runner/miniforge3/conda-bld/libtool_1596899629849/_build_env/bin/x86_64-apple-darwin13.4.0-as"

```
Note Mac's libtool is different from GNU libtool. When you `brew install libtool` you are actually installing glibtool.

Therefore when you build `libtool` with other environment, you get the relocation nightmare. One way to stop is to remove prefix e.g. like [this](https://github.com/conda-forge/libtool-feedstock/pull/22) for all env vars and do some post built dirty removing.

### Neovim Sticked to Lua5.1
> Multiversion & coexists package is hard in many pkg manager including Conda

Lua5.1 is not back compatible since 5.3. So, things get more and more sticky. I created PR to solve.

ðŸ¥´I'm now dreaming neovim was [written in Rust](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/8669).

## Fasd
> Command line (bash etc.) script has conflicting requirements

The ticket is sticked to whether we should include bash in conda while conda is relies on bash. This is more a philosophy/belief type of argument. I realized don't have much time then and drop the conversation and later fell into new love zoxide, which is much faster and also kinds of migrating my pkg army to [Nix](./2020-10-24-nix-power) which is more rootily powerful.

## Zoxide
> my z for conda
Just created the ticket and rust recipes are pretty standard...

Be guided to solve the license files for zoxide... Hope it goes smoothly.
