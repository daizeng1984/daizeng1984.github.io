These ancient magic powered machina is more than 10 years ago. It was operated by ancient experts...

# Reminder
Ok, here's my ancient sites: http://blog.sina.com.cn/u/1889114642 . Some are in Chinese.

Today, I just got an overdue `reminder` from sina that I should migrate my page or at least backup images: they shut down sina photo/image store after 2019 which reminds me they could dump my everything if for example they need extra disk usage. Same reminder happened 10+ years ago as well when MSN shut down.

I hope github free land will be there forever...


# Step 1
I just copied and paste things here, but I lost some post & imges ðŸ˜¢. 

### Simple Refraction

I would like to say, peopleâ€™s (as least for people who did not see that before â˜º) eyes are really forgiving. I originally planned to do some research on RenderMonkeyâ€™s ToolSuite SDK to precompute normal distance Wyman [2005]. Now, without any precomputation, but crude and direct approximation. These pictures are only beautiful in pictures and too ugly in theoryâ˜º. I think it could be used in game.

Since there are no work worth mentioning, just show some pictures.

# Step 2
Try to recover my original post resources (e.g. iamges) from my backup tomb. I guess
