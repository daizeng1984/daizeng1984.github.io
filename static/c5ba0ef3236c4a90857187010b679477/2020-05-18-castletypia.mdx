import {SimonSpriteDemo} from '../adhoc/blog/castletypia.js'

If your kid love Castlevania and they are interested in computer [TL;DR](#simon-sprite-demo)...

# Why?
My kids loves Castlevania when he saw me played in Nintendo virtual console. Graphics/sound effect are simple enough for him to digest.

So why not make a typing game and meanwhile play a bit of PIXI.js (haven't done serious project for a bit while ðŸ˜œ)?

## Ambush! Webpack Complains
Because gatsby try to render the page and staticize it using server side rendering (please see [here](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/13355)). For our app, it's dynamic js so we need to stop it, by wrapping our modules with LazyLoader components as below:

```javascript
import Loadable from "@loadable/component"
export const SimonSpriteDemo = Loadable(() => import("./castletypia/simon-sprite-demo.js"))
```

## WebGL and Legacy
It turns out My Linux's Firefox doesn't support webgl well... For larger audience with no WebGL but only html5 I turned off it by installing the `legacy PIXI` and import the right pkgs:

```json
    "pixi.js-legacy": "^5.3.3",
```

```javascript
import {
  ...
} from '@inlet/react-pixi/legacy';

...

const stageOptions = {
  forceCanvas: true,
}
```

## [React PIXI.js](https://reactpixi.org/)!
Good someone already have done something for react! But they don't support animation timing (different duration for each frame at this point)?

Let's customize our own component! 

```javascript
const MyAnimatedSprite = PixiComponent('MyAnimatedSprite', {
    create: (props)=>{
        const { frameObjects, images, isPlaying = true, initialFrame } = props
        const animatedSprite = new PIXI.AnimatedSprite(frameObjects)
        animatedSprite[isPlaying ? 'gotoAndPlay' : 'gotoAndStop'](initialFrame || 0)
        return animatedSprite
    },
    applyProps:(instance, oldProps, newProps) => {
        const { frameObjects, isPlaying, initialFrame, ...props } = newProps

        applyDefaultProps(instance, oldProps, props)

        if (frameObjects && oldProps['frameObjects'] !== frameObjects) {
            instance.textures = (frameObjects)
            instance.gotoAndPlay(0)
        }

        if (isPlaying !== oldProps.isPlaying || initialFrame !== oldProps.initialFrame) {
            const frame = typeof initialFrame === 'number' ? initialFrame : instance.currentFrame || 0
            instance[isPlaying ? 'gotoAndPlay' : 'gotoAndStop'](frame)
        }
        return instance
    }
})
```

This `MyAnimatedSprite` do similar what `AnimatedSprite` does but accept frameObjects as defined here:

```javascript
export interface FrameObject {
    texture: Texture;
    time: number;
    }
```

# Sprites!
2D game is all about sprite. We just need animation texture and its meta file (json). For texture, I found Simon sprite [here](http://supermariobroscrossover.com/media/simon-belmont-castlevania.290/#media) and with some basic painting tool e.g. gimp, I slowly locate their coordinates and sprite size... basically to fill these format:

```json
    "frames": {
        "walk0":
        {
            "frame": {"x":29,"y":22,"w":16,"h": 32},
            "rotated": false,
            "trimmed": true,
            "spriteSourceSize": {"x":0,"y":0,"w":16,"h":32},
            "sourceSize": {"w":16,"h":32}
        },
        ...
    }
```

For the frameObjects, I created my definition of animations that'll be compatible with `AnimatedSprite`:

```json
{
    "my_animations": {
        "walk": [
        {
            "texture": "walk0",
            "time": 200
        }
        ...
    }
```

Okay, now here it is:

<div id='simon-sprite-demo'/>
