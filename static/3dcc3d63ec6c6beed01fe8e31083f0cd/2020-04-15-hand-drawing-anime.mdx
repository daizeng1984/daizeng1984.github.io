Sometimes I do graph by hand as well. This post is to mock the manga artists I like when growing up and apply their drawing skill to Final Fantasy 7 to see how their style adapt to new story...


# Requirement
A decent knowledge of 80s manga, anime and Japan RPG video game. 

# Covid-19 At Home 24 Days

Final Fatansy 7 Remake inspired this test idea. [Here](https://cdn-prod.scalefast.com/public/assets/img/resized/squareenix-store-v3/46f45ae4ab4eccc1c7ad7a83d2abfb7d_1920_KR.jpg)'re the main characters.

Now here comes my `hand drawing` dump:

![Doraemon FF7](../images/blog/2020/doramon.jpg)
![Saint Seiya FF7](../images/blog/2020/saint_seiya.jpg)
![Dragon Ball FF7](../images/blog/2020/dragon_ball.jpg)



As you could see, artist [Takehiko Inoue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takehiko_Inoue) is a clear win because of his realistic style. [Fujiko Fujio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fujiko_Fujio) and [Y≈çichi Takahashi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y%C5%8Dichi_Takahashi) struggles because they chose young kids appealing style.

[Masami Kurumada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masami_Kurumada) and [Akira Toriyama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akira_Toriyama) are fine with the new story. Akira Toriyama's drawing is too stylish and you probably feel you are still watch the series e.g. Dragon Ball X or some Gaiden of Dragon Quest XVI.

Note Masami Kurumada pay many attention to the metal armor while Takehiko Inoue focus on sweat of people and huge amount of details in face.


Ok, made my day! How about you?üòÉ
