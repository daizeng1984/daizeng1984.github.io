Just a bit of funny thinking for basic programming design concept...

# Communication: Callback vs Message
Callback is mostly like a pager, brutally you got paged everytime when client is trying to find you. It's efficient because it's simply a function call. Sometime, you are not ready! For example, early in the morning, you are basically naked and not initialized and callback comes...

Some game engine is using these just because they are simply efficient and pager are ususally organized into batch by batch. For example, they set an order of expected call (life cycle) and ask every components to follow the rule.

A better way might be, if efficiency is not concerns, using message box to allow some autonomy of components, where sometimes we call actor. We assume each actor is proactively doing their job and they can do at their own pace. The good thing is each actor know his agenda well. The bad part is sometime you don't have control over their behavior. They can ignore your order/call. Also because of the quite decoupled design, this design can handle complicate concurrency. With better communication tool (message system) and remote working device setup, you can actually achieve quite some performance. Actor framework is like this.
