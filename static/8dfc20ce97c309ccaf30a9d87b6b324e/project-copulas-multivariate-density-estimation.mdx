In the decision and estimation fusion of multisensor system, it’s difficult to get enough samples of joint density. We introduced the copula based method that using marginal to tune the joint density to improve efficiency. I'm so bought by this idea, and believe it can be very useful for comptuer science field e.g. decouple some functions.
