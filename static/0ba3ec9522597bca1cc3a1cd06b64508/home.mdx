## Welcome!
Hello, I'm Zeng Dai. I do web and graphics, by writing code. I picture myself: a problem solver, builder, and truth seeker. I'm also an ex-game developer and an enthusiastic learner of every technology within my radar. Just love the feeling of learning and building cool stuff combo with challenges. 

As you might find out, I have broad interest which spans from time to time: from math/statistics to computer science, from 3D real time rendering to web dev, from big data visualization to deep learning. This experience makes me a very unique graphics person (knowing both arcane & dark magic). In my view, new technologies and buzzwords flies by, yet coding and learning remains unchanged. My recent interest lands in neural network application for our daily life and I believe building its platform for everyone is the next big matter.

Feel free to explore around my pages where I could log my personal stuff and random rant about code, research, technologies, and life.
