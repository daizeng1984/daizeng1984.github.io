bgfx support many platform, let's see if we can embed it on this post...

# Bgfx
Bgfx is a powerful rendering API help you to deal with lots of cross rendering API including WebGL! With emscripten, you can programming in familiar C++/rendering API and compile it to wasm that runs in browser. Good thing about wasm is: it allows your app be accessed by anyone with browser.

WebGL & mobile graphics is the relative low end, if you manage to run on these platform, it also prove that it can run anywhere.
