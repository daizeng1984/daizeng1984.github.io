BTW, I also love cooking...

# Why
When you are stuck at home with limit access to restaurants, or when you just realized how many sugars/oil (unfavorable gradients) are put in your favorable food, or when you want to optimize the ancient traditional way of cooking arts, you start to think about create a channel for cooking at home.

Also acuquired some video editing skill recently: why not use them?

# Background
As Szechuanese, oil-spicy fragrant is my favorite. I don't like most raw flavor from meat, blood or guts so I try my best to either get rid of them or combine them with different smell and flavor e.g. all kinds of spice and herbs.

As an engineer, I don't like complicate or unoptimized way of cooking. I feel it wastes energy and could be greener. I don't pursue ultimate flavor but balanced fastest way to produce plausible flavor close to groundtruth (so-called authentic dish).

Having limited time, this post will just serve as intro and gateway to all videos shared:
