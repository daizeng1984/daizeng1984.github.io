Just cool ...

# Non-Root
If this bothers you ...

1. Namespace `nix-user-chroot`. However, it cannot support [tmux reattachment](TODO) (hope this is tmux fault).
2. Proot allow tmux to reattach, however, it has limit os support for certain system call which is very hard to find out when it happens. 
3. Build your own stuff and troubleshooting all on your own.

Namespace is recommended however in Mac it seems to be impossible.

# Direnv
Nix ‚ù§ Direnv. These two are so powerful. Direnv grants you seamless environment while Nix guarantees they are reliable and reproducible. My rest blogs are merely snippets of these two.

# NodeJS
Remember `npm install -g`? Now it's not allowed and neither good practice. You either install them via `withPackage` style or relies on direnv to respect local `node_modules` folder. 

# Emscripten
Webassembly? Easy piece:


# Rust
Rust is relatively new and keeps evolving all the time, so we need to use the newest updates from mozilla's channel:

```nix
```

# Python
Install pkgs in read-only nix python is impossible. You either use local pip (virtual python env) or manage packages in nix. With nix, you don't need to worry about the native package like cython etc..

# Cpp
Nix is the best CPP dev pkg manager in *nix OS I'd say, since C++ pkgs are mostly low level and OS related. For continuous integration I haven't look into Nix power, but for reproducible dev environment setup under linux. Nix provides the best solution.

## NDK

# Jdk
## Android
