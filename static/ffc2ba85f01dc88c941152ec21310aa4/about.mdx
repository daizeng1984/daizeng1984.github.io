### About Work
I'm a graphics research engineer @ [Tiktok](tiktok.com)'s AR Effect Platform Team. Before joining Tiktok, I'm a research engineer @ [Bosch Research](http://www.bosch.us/content/language1/html/rtc.htm) productizing big data & eXplainable AI web app, 3D map, & hand/glove capturing etc.. In 2015, I joined [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/) Retail (hardline) as SDE where I spent a great time learning web dev with enthusiastic colleagues.

My earlier industrial experience started with [Ubisoft](https://www.ubisoft.com/en-GB/) in 2008 as a software developer for [Rayman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rayman) HD.
I have computer science, statistics and mathematics background and thus a "mixture" of [geeky/nerdy](https://slackprop.wordpress.com/2013/06/03/on-geek-versus-nerd/) things.

I hand on lots of tech but never overfit my tech brain and here's the keywords I try to define my tech league: real-time, full-stack, GPU, AI, scale, productization, engineering focus.

I love graphics, however, I'm a TUI guy when coming to coding, or more precisely a Vim+Tmux guy always carrying his [backpack](https://github.com/daizeng1984/dotfiles).

I've recently been quite interested in deep learning, if you get any ideas or opportunities, please contact [me](/assets/cv/zeng-resume.html).

### About Academy
In 2014, I graduated from [University of Iowa](http://www.uiowa.edu/) where I spent wonderful years studying 3D real time rendering with my advisor [Chris Wyman](http://cwyman.org/). I also have M.S. degree in Probability and Mathematics Statistics and B.S. degree in Applied Mathematics from [Sichuan University](http://www.scu.edu.cn/en/), where I worked on theoretical research (statistics) of multi-sensor fusion with Prof. [Yunmin Zhu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=cN4yYyoAAAAJ&hl=en).

I have two "lovely" kids with my wife living in bay area. As expected, <WilliamAge/> while <AlexAge/>.

<!-- (Wait, for quantum physics, I have my own interpretation regarding [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIyTZDHuarQ) one).  -->

During weekends, I enjoy playing <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faLaptop}/>, <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faGamepad}/>, <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faUserEdit}/> and sometimes go out to nature <FontAwesomeIcon style={{color:"green"}} icon={faTree}/> for fresh air.
