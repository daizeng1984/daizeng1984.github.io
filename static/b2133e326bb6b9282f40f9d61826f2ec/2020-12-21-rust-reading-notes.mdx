While baby is sleeping, let's get some readings and keep notes...

# Rust In Action (MEAP) (‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê)
Expected to find some lang system level explanation (e.g. virtual function table, garbage collector mechanism) instead of common lang features.

## Why? Rust?
Perform like C++ yet without the historical burdens. Speaks like a cool scripting lang yet powerful enough to handle system level.

# Intros
### Number Type
* Conversion is explicit through `as`
* Each type has its method like *24.5_f32*.`round()` is method to round *24.5_f32* to *25*.
* Format type "{:b}{:o}{:x}". 
* Float comparison is tolerate with e.g. `f32::EPSILON`.
* `num` crate extend primitive types to support e.g. complex, big integer/infinite float, fixed point currency decimal

### Iteration
* for x in 0..10 
* for x in `collection.iter()` or `&collection`
* `iter_mut` is mutable while `into_iter` is value typed

### Flow
* loop { if ... break }
* match `0..=40` is range of [0, 40], `|` is or and `_` is otherwise

### Function Signature
* fn lifetime<'a, 'b>(x: &'a i32, y: &' i32) -> i32
* fn add<T: std::ops::Add<Output=T> + std::ops::Multiply >
* str -> c style static ; String -> std::string 
* Arrays -> c style Slice -> new/malloc Vector -> c++ vec
* #![allow(unused_variables)] #![allow(dead_code)] and unimplemnted! macro

### Struct
* name: String == [u8; name.size ] and data: Vec\<u8\> == [u8; data.size] and they are most possibly on heap
* impl, self and return (default last one, note `;`) 

### Implementation
* unsafe block is used when check global in system level programming, and static globals are all capital
* panic! to throw exception
* const vs let: const is like c/c++ `const` during compile time and define fixed array while `let` is runtime. `let` is more of shared reference.
* Result<T, String> -> Ok(T) or Err(String) and `unwrap()`
* trait ... fn(self &Self ...) and impl SomeTrait for YourClass. It's like interface and implements/extend
* `#[derive(Debug)]` is for auto trait generation
* pub as export
* //! for modules/files /// for next code and `rustdoc` to render the documents

## types
```rust
i8, i16, i32, i64, i128, isize
u8, u16, u32, u64, u128, usize
f32, f64
char (unicode 4 bytes)
bool
() empty tuple
struct Tensor(i32, i32) //tuple
struct Point{
x: i32, y: i32
}
enum PointType {
    OneDimension, // default 0 but can be =1
    TwoDimension,
    ThreeDimension,
} //enum

[T; length] //array
const COMPILE_TIME_VALUE : i32 = 10;
static STATIC_VALUE : &str = 'Unsafe'; // unsafe if you mut it
let mut mutable = 1; //can change but you can let mutable = mutable; to unmut it üòÑ
```
### destructure value assignment
```rust
let Point{x: point1_x, y: point1_y} = point1;
```
### impl to attach fn
```rust
impl Abstract {
    fn ...
}
```

### type conversion
Require impl the traits if you convert e.g. &str -> String
```rust
impl From<i32> for Number { //TryFrom is the fallible equivalent
    fn from(s: i32) -> Self {
        Number { value: s }
    }
}
```
### flow
```rust
for n = 1..=n {
    ...
}
match number {
    1 => println!("One!"),
    2 | 3 | 5 | 7 | 11 => println!("This is a prime"),
    13..=19 => println!("A teen"),
    _ => println!("Ain't special"),
}
```
