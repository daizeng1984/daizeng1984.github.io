Chicken breast is rubbery like chewing a deck of paper. But I remembered in China I had quite some dishes that chicken were so tender. Something must be wrong in my cooking knowledge. Let's fix it. 

# Some Ideas
There are mainly 2 theories that I find making sense based on my experience:
* Cook the chicken slowly and precisely control the temperature of cooking. This make sense because [Onsen Tamago](https://www.justonecookbook.com/onsen-tamago/) mainly rely on this technique.
* Brining and marinating the chicken in salty/sugary water to break the protein structure (you might think of it as some type of cook) so that this is not normal chicken meat anymore :sweat_smile:. I did this before and it does work. One pros for this technique is that I like meat to be well done in most cases.
