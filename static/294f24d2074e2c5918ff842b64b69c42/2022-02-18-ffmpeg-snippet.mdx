Why would ppl design API like this?

# Motivation
Like opengl, these low level api is very tedious and old. I'm surprised that we don't even have a header only wrapper for ffmpeg? This time let's first use boilerplate snippet to fix.

This is for myself: I Just Want to Load Video and Get RGBA!

# Bonus
What if performance is not my concern? and I just want to hack something...
