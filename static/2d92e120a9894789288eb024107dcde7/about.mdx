### About Work
I'm currently a sr. research engineer in Visual Computing Group @ [Bosch Research](http://www.bosch.us/content/language1/html/rtc.htm), Sunnyvale, CA. 
Before I joined Bosch in 2015, I worked on web dev and services in Product & Service Discovery Group @ [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/) where I spent a great time with enthusiastic colleagues.


My earlier industrial experience started with [Ubisoft](https://www.ubisoft.com/en-GB/) back in 2008 where I worked as a software developer for [Rayman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rayman) HD. 
I have computer science, statistics and mathematics background and thus a "mixture" of [geeky/nerdy](https://slackprop.wordpress.com/2013/06/03/on-geek-versus-nerd/) things.

I handed on lots of tech and never overfit my tech brain and here's the keywords I like tech ads: real-time, full-stack, scale, research productization, engineering focus.

I did a lot of graphics, however, I'm also a TUI guy when coming to coding, or more precisely a Vim+Tmux guy because of limited fingers.

I've recently been quite interested in deep learning, if you get any ideas or opportunities, please contact [me](/assets/cv/zeng-resume.html).

I have two "lovely" kids with my wife living in bay area. As expected, <WilliamAge/> while <AlexAge/>.

During weekends, I enjoy playing <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faLaptop}/>, <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faGamepad}/>, <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faUserEdit}/> and sometimes go out to nature <FontAwesomeIcon style={{color:"green"}} icon={faTree}/> for fresh air.
