# Reminder
Ok, here's my ancient sites: http://blog.sina.com.cn/u/1889114642 . Some are in Chinese.

Today, I just got an overdue `reminder` from sina that I should migrate my page or at least backup images: they shut down sina photo/image store after 2019 which reminds me they could dump my everything if for example they need extra disk usage. Same reminder happened 10+ years ago as well when MSN shut down.

I hope github free land will be there forever...

Try to recover my original post resources (e.g. iamges) from my backup tomb. Might be missing, if cannot found. I'll just post things here. I'll also remove duplicate content if any.

# Step 2
I just copied and paste things in this blog one post one day when I find i, but I lost some post & imges ðŸ˜¢. 

Posts recover so far:
