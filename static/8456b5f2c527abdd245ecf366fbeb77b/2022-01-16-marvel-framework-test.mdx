Marvel has an excellent framework to integrate its comics into a unified Marvel universe. Let's see if we can apply the same framework to [Shanghai Animation Film Studio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai_Animation_Film_Studio)'s movies and TV series to make another hero universe.

# Titles We Plans to Integrate
### [Calabash Brothers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calabash_Brothers)

### [Three Monks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Monks)

# Background Setup
We need to set the background to universe. Once you set it as universe, it brings so much flexibility to connect across different titles and make your story logical and convincing when you bring all heroes & heorines together.

We need a big villain and a mainline story, so let's create it, `Gsenos` mapping to Marvel's `Thanos`.
