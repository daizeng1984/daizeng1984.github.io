Taste next gen C lang...

# Bugs
If you played Cyberpunk 2077 at this time on consoles, you'll hate the bugs like missing texture/geom, crappy physics, weird AI etc. and most of them look very mutithready. Symptom shows this game's threading is messily async under console compiler env and thus not playable. But it's good lesson for developers.

Rust, as a more secure (especially for multithreads) and yet efficient lang, recently catches my eyes and [some people](https://hub.packtpub.com/rust-as-a-game-programming-language-is-it-any-good/) believe it can replace (at least somewhat) the long-live C++ for game dev. Hmmm🤔, interesting... Even though lang is not the one to blame for messy C++ game code, I still wish there'll be a cleaner/stricter language to branch from C++ (instead of merging tons of developer requests) so that developer doesn't need to create wheels, hack dynamic features etc. for application like game. C++ after 2013ish is full of sugars. It becomes more and more syntax-complicate like a new language. Too many burdens. Developers under C++ are not necessarily following strict rules that potentially leading to hard-to-find bugs like uninitialized resources, possibly lock threads etc..

More, Rust claims it uses stricter compiling check to make sure a more reliable run time code, which means like human languages Rust requires you to elaborate your statements to remove many ambiguities. A lot of cli app I used are written by Rust. Besides, with like other mainstream langs, it has friendlier pkg manager than C++.

So maybe Rust can be the one? 

# Rust
To learn Rust, [here](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)'s the official course. To play it, either `Nix` it like introduced in my previous [post](./2020-12-10-nix-power-2) or webly [here](https://play.rust-lang.org/).

❗❗❗Notes for myself that went through [this](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/primitives.html), please ❗❗❗[SKIP](#skip_notes)❗❗❗:

### types
```rust
i8, i16, i32, i64, i128, isize
u8, u16, u32, u64, u128, usize
f32, f64
char (unicode 4 bytes)
bool
() empty tuple
struct Tensor(i32, i32) //tuple
struct Point{
x: i32, y: i32
}
enum PointType {
    OneDimension, // default 0 but can be =1
    TwoDimension,
    ThreeDimension,
} //enum

[T; length] //array
const COMPILE_TIME_VALUE : i32 = 10;
static STATIC_VALUE : &str = 'Unsafe'; // unsafe if you mut it
let mut mutable = 1; //can change but you can let mutable = mutable; to unmut it 😄
```
#### destructure value assignment
```rust
let Point{x: point1_x, y: point1_y} = point1;
```
#### impl to attach fn
```rust
impl Abstract {
    fn ...
}
```

#### type conversion
Require impl the traits if you convert e.g. &str -> String
```rust
impl From<i32> for Number { //TryFrom is the fallible equivalent
    fn from(s: i32) -> Self {
        Number { value: s }
    }
}
```

# Engines

## QuickSilver
## Amethyst
[Amethyst](https://www.amethyst.rs/) seems to be almost ripe and it support [Nix](./2020-10-24-nix-power) so let's try that out. It uses entity components system to model multithread behavior I guess similar to actor framework etc. by Erlang. These model ensured some atomity behavior to avoid dead lock etc.. 

You need to pin down to `1.47.0` according to this [issue](https://github.com/amethyst/amethyst/issues/2524). Of course for 3D graphics, also run with `[nixGL]()` to enable hardware for non nixos env like my centos.

```nix
let
  mozilla = import (builtins.fetchTarball https://github.com/mozilla/nixpkgs-mozilla/archive/master.tar.gz);
  nixpkgs = import <nixpkgs> { overlays = [ mozilla ]; };
in
with nixpkgs;
mkShell {
  buildInputs = [
    alsaLib
    cmake
    freetype
    (rustChannelOf { channel = "1.47.0"; }).rust
    expat
    openssl
    pkgconfig
    python3
    vulkan-validation-layers
    xlibs.libX11
  ];

  APPEND_LIBRARY_PATH = stdenv.lib.makeLibraryPath [
    vulkan-loader
    xlibs.libXcursor
    xlibs.libXi
    xlibs.libXrandr
  ];

  shellHook = ''
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$APPEND_LIBRARY_PATH"
  '';
}
```
