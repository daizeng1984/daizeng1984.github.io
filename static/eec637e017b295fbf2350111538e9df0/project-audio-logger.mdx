My wife (jinniegithb) and I found we sometimes need an app to log our daily activities without typing (carrying a baby) so that we could track them later. A short briefing or chat is good enough. The neat thing about setting up this app by yourself is: you totally own your data 😉. In the future, we could probably add some speech-to-text functionality...
