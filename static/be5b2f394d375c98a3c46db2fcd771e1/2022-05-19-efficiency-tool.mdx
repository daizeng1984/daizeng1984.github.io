Who doesn't love faster tools?

# TL;DR
> conda's mamba

```sh
conda install -y -n base -c conda-forge conda-libmamba-solver
```

Basically a rewrite of conda in C++. It's also multithreaded. You can directly install mamba dep solver to use conda as you used to and get faster install experience.


> cmake-init

```sh
cmake-init
```
Sit and get boilerplate `CMakeLists.txt` file generated with a few typing. You can also get `conan` for package manager.

> CPM

```cmake
set(CPM_DOWNLOAD_VERSION 0.27.2) 
set(CPM_DOWNLOAD_LOCATION "${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/cmake/CPM_${CPM_DOWNLOAD_VERSION}.cmake")

if(NOT (EXISTS ${CPM_DOWNLOAD_LOCATION}))
    message(STATUS "Downloading CPM.cmake")
    file(DOWNLOAD https://github.com/TheLartians/CPM.cmake/releases/download/v${CPM_DOWNLOAD_VERSION}/CPM.cmake ${CPM_DOWNLOAD_LOCATION})
endif()

include(${CPM_DOWNLOAD_LOCATION})
```
Copy paste into your `CMakeLists.txt` and you get cmake's native "package manager" for free.
```cmake
CPMAddPackage(
    NAME spdlog
    GITHUB_REPOSITORY gabime/spdlog
    VERSION 1.7.0)
# ... and then

target_link_libraries(your_lib
    spdlog)
```
