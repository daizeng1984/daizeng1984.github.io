Starting to refresh my OpenGL brain and figure a good chance to make tool sharp to survive in wild OpenGL Programming... TL;DR [here]()

# Prerequisites
Install your favorite snippets engine e.g. coc-snippets and point it to your customized snippets like I did [here](?). Setting up a working environment can be frustrating. If you work in \*nix, I got your back. Just install [Nix]() and [direnv](). Works best for Linux machine though. For more details, see my previous [post](./2020-12-10-nix-power-2).

# GL Snippets
## Header
I meant survive in wild but not naked. You need these almost must-have headers. With GLFW, you don't need to worry about GL context binding to native window. With GLAD you care less about OGL entry point. GLM saves you some scratch work to implement e.g. vec2.

```cpp
// Generate your own header https://github.com/Dav1dde/glad/tree/glad2
#include <glad/glad.h>
#define GLFW_INCLUDE_NONE
#include <GLFW/glfw3.h>
#include <glm/glm.hpp>
#define STB_IMAGE_IMPLEMENTATION
#include <stb_image.h>
```

## Basic Assets
### Geometry
Would you like a triangle?
```cpp
const GLfloat triangleVertex[] = {
   -1.0f, -1.0f, 0.0f,
   1.0f, -1.0f, 0.0f,
   0.0f,  1.0f, 0.0f,
};
```
Cube, and teapot are also in snippets, but a bit wordy.

### Shader
For exmaple, to quickly grab a working embedded shader is very handy.
```cpp
const char* vertexShader =
"#version ${1:400}\n"
"in vec3 vp;"
"void main() {"
"  gl_Position = vec4(vp, 1.0);"
"}";
```

## Push/Pop States
API leaves for you to manage all states, my dear. Let's finish it with one blow by enumerating all states possible. Cause you never know which state is giving you black screen ðŸ¤¦.
```cpp

```

## \*\*O
VBO, VAO, EBO, FBO how can you confuse us like that ðŸ˜‚? The reason is probably left for driver programmer to explain. But here a simple explanation: VBO is just buffer to store vertex, FBO is buffer to store pixels, while VAO is wrapper to manage VBO.

## Image & Texture
To test a simple image...

# Test Our Snippets
## Case 1
To draw a triangle to see if opengl works. Type `glhellworld` to get the stub and fill the loop code with `glsimplevsfs`, `glshader`, `glvao`, `glvbo` and then `gldraw`. Totally time spent 1 min.

## Case 2
Draw lighting with 

# Vulkan Snippets
Ok, OpenGL is not that bad. Let's crack Vulkan.
