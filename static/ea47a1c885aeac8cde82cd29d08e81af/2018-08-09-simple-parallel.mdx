[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)'s concurrent script is great! Inspiredly today I just made yet another simple helper script that do similar things and keep everything simple (only bash shell).

# Install
Just `ln` [this shell script](https://github.com/daizeng1984/dotfiles/blob/experimental/.local/bin/simple_parallel) and expose it to your path e.g. `/usr/local/bin`
```bash
cd /usr/local/bin && ln -s $HOME/.dotfiles/misc/simple_parallel.sh simple_parallel && cd -
```

# Example
![Run simple_parallel](../images/blog/2018/simple-parallel-example.png)

That's right, just type lines of command in your double quote input and it'll run each of them in parallel. This script only uses the most common commands found in *nix os and you can kill all the process using <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>c</kbd>
