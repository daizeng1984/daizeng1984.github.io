Case by Case, for series I we will start from very basic one: Crawler.
## Crawler
Crawler seems to be so simple that looks like a course project from CS 101. However it can be really hard! Think about a huge engineering team in Google is trying to do this correct. So it's not that easy.

what's missing in our project? Let's get back to problem and this time we think it seriously considering all could happens.

System that visit one web page, and then extract the url from page content and then continue to traverse the url do similar things.

1. Scalability. WWW
2. Distributed structure
3. Adversary. robot spam site,
