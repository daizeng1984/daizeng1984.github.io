Annoying google drive share link issue if you just copy/paste...

# Problem

Recently getting more and more lazy to organize images through blog folders, link to Google Drive seems to be a convenient way for me.

Yet, haunted by this issues of converting:
> https://drive.google.com/file/d/{ID}/view?usp=sharing

to:

> https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id={ID}

# Solution
Put this in your Ultisnip:
```

```

Then it grab the register/clipboard and return the correct google drive link as markdown image. But it's essentially just vim command. Feel free to convert the line after `!v` into your vim command.
