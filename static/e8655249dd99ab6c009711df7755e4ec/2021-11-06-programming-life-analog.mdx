Just a bit of funny thinking for basic programming design concept...

# Callback vs Reactive
Callback is mostly like a pager, brutally you got paged everytime when client is trying to find you. It's efficient because it's simply a function call. Sometime, you are not ready! For example, early in the morning, you are basically naked and not initialized and callback comes...

So a better way is 
# Concurrent
