These ancient magic powered machina are more than 10 years ago. It was operated by ancient 'experts'...

# Reminder
Ok, here's my ancient sites: http://blog.sina.com.cn/u/1889114642 . Some are in Chinese and others are poorly written English (also true for now ðŸ˜‰).

Today, I just got an overdue `reminder` from sina that I should migrate my page or at least backup images: they shut down sina photo/image store after 2019 which reminds me they could dump my everything when for example they need extra disk usage some years later. Same reminder happened 10+ years ago as well when MSN shut down. It reminds me I should always backup ancient blog.

Also I hope github free land will be there forever...


# Step 1
Try to recover my original post resources (e.g. iamges) from my backup tomb. Might be missing, if cannot found. I'll just post things here. I'll also remove duplicate content if any.

# Step 2

Big plan: I copy and paste things to this blog one post per week, but I lost some post & imges ðŸ˜¢. 

Posts recover so far:
