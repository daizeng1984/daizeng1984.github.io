While baby is sleeping, let's get some readings and keep notes...

# Rust In Action (MEAP) (⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐)
Expected to find some lang system level explanation (e.g. virtual function table, garbage collector mechanism) instead of common lang features.

## Why? Rust?
Perform like C++ yet without the historical burdens. Speaks like a cool scripting lang yet powerful enough to handle system level.

![Rust](https://media.nature.com/lw800/magazine-assets/d41586-020-03382-2/d41586-020-03382-2_18629102.png)

# Type
Conversion is explicit and each type has its method like 24.5_f32.round() is to round 24.5 to 25

# Official Guide Reading Notes
[Examples](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/)

## types
```rust
i8, i16, i32, i64, i128, isize
u8, u16, u32, u64, u128, usize
f32, f64
char (unicode 4 bytes)
bool
() empty tuple
struct Tensor(i32, i32) //tuple
struct Point{
x: i32, y: i32
}
enum PointType {
    OneDimension, // default 0 but can be =1
    TwoDimension,
    ThreeDimension,
} //enum

[T; length] //array
const COMPILE_TIME_VALUE : i32 = 10;
static STATIC_VALUE : &str = 'Unsafe'; // unsafe if you mut it
let mut mutable = 1; //can change but you can let mutable = mutable; to unmut it 😄
```
### destructure value assignment
```rust
let Point{x: point1_x, y: point1_y} = point1;
```
### impl to attach fn
```rust
impl Abstract {
    fn ...
}
```

### type conversion
Require impl the traits if you convert e.g. &str -> String
```rust
impl From<i32> for Number { //TryFrom is the fallible equivalent
    fn from(s: i32) -> Self {
        Number { value: s }
    }
}
```
### flow
```rust
for n = 1..=n {
    ...
}
match number {
    1 => println!("One!"),
    2 | 3 | 5 | 7 | 11 => println!("This is a prime"),
    13..=19 => println!("A teen"),
    _ => println!("Ain't special"),
}
```
