You don't need to learn Rust to enjoy its eco benefits (fast & secure flavor). This post is ads of the tools written by Rust and I enjoy using!

* **RipGrep**: `grep` \< `ag` \< `rg`. Fast!
* **fd**: better modern find. fast!
* **zoxide**: `j/autojump` \< `z/fasd` \< `zoxide`
* **cbs**: cross *nix clipboard.
