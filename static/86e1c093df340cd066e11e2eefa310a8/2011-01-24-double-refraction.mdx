Implemented Chris' double surface refraction...


# Refraction

I would like to say, peopleâ€™s (as least for people who did not see that before ðŸ™‚) eyes are really forgiving. I originally planned to do some research on RenderMonkeyâ€™s ToolSuite SDK to precompute normal distance Wyman [2005]. Now, without any precomputation, but crude and direct approximation. These pictures are only beautiful in pictures and too ugly in theoryðŸ™‚. I think it could be used in game.

Since there are no work worth mentioning, just show some pictures.

# Single Refraction

# Double Refraction
